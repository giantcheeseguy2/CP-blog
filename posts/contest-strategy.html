<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li>First thing to do is always to read all the problems.
<ul>
<li>Identify the seemingly easiest and work on that first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus at one problem at a time. Spreading out your thoughts will only make you less productive.</li>
<li>Make sure to leave at least 30 minutes for thinking about each problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thinking Phase</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unless full solution is relatively obvious, try to solve each subtask
<ul>
<li>If you have a subtask solution just code it. The time cost is not that high.</li>
<li>Always code a trivial brute force and verify it by submitting. It will verify your understanding as well as being helpful for stress testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First thing to do is work out samples/write out cases and notice properties. Helps solve the problem and verifies your understanding. Work out base cases and try to think from small to large.</li>
<li>Write down everything while thinking
<ul>
<li>When formulating a solution, write down all thoughts no matter how useful they seem. They will eventually lead somewhere.
<ul>
<li>Every equivalence</li>
<li>Every reduction</li>
<li>Every observation</li>
<li>Every algorithm or trick</li>
<li>Possible properties (even if not proven)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the thinking part of the problem, just go through ideas as fast as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For some problems it is optimal to try to fix an technique and solve using that technique. For others, making observations will be faster. Use your better judgement.</li>
<li>Some observations/reductions will be completely irrelevant to the solution. If you feel some obesrvation is a trap, just force yourself to not think about it. Don't let your brain trick you into not &quot;wasting&quot; your previous efforts.</li>
<li>If the problem is reduced to something seemingly classic that you cannot solve, there are a few possibilities.
<ul>
<li>Your reduction is completely wrong.</li>
<li>There are some special properties of the problem structure that you are missing.</li>
<li>This is a standard technique that you have not learned yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you no longer feel productive, go take a break for a couple minutes. After coming back, reset and pretend like you are starting a new contest.</li>
<li>Possible Techniques:
<ul>
<li>Sqrt</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Divide and Conquer</li>
<li>Offline</li>
<li>Backwards</li>
<li>Fix a variable</li>
<li>Visualize on a plane</li>
<li>Visualize as a graph/tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible Algorithms
<ul>
<li>Data Structure</li>
<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
<li>Greedy</li>
<li>Binary Lifting</li>
<li>Binary Search</li>
<li>Prefix Sums</li>
<li>Flows</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possibly Useful Observations
<ul>
<li>Invariance</li>
<li>Monotonic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coding Phase</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the implementation seems short, just go for it.</li>
<li>For longer implementations
<ul>
<li>Run it on the samples first. Nothing worse than coding something only to find out your idea is wrong on samples</li>
<li>Work out the details and some other cases. Nothing worse than coding something only find out your idea is wrong on everything but samples</li>
<li>If you are going off an assumption based on instinct, good luck. Theres probably a 50 50 chance of it passing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrong answer?
<ul>
<li>Look over code for a few minutes to find obvious bugs</li>
<li>If no obvious bugs, go straight to stress testing. Takes 1 minute to write a generator (ideally you already have the brute force), and will instantly find an edge case. Much more efficient than working out cases or debugging by hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
