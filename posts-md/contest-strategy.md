## General
-   Focus at one problem at a time.
-   Make sure to leave at least 1 hour for each problem.
-   Spend at least 20 mins on each problem coding brute force.

## Thinking
- Write down thoughts.
- If stuck over 10 mins, reread statements.
	- Weird conditions? Properties?
- Guess time complexity.
- Brainstorm known algorithms.
    - _String_: Suffix Array? KMP? Trie? DP?
    - _Tree_: Centroid / D&C? HLD? Tree Traversals?
    - _Graph_: DSU? Dijkstra? BCC? SCC? 2-SAT? Flows?
    - _Data-structure_: Segtree? Treap? Small to Large?
    - _Math_: DP? Pattern Finding?
- Others:
    - Greedy?
    - Sqrt?
    - Random?
    - Hashing?
    - Backwards?
    - Pattern Finding?
- Make sure to spend at least 10 mins thinking about each type of algorithm.
- Try to combine algorithms.
- Check your algorithm with samples.
