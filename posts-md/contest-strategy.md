## General

-   Focus at one problem at a time.
-   Make sure to leave at least 30 minutes for thinking about each problem.
-   Spend at least 10 mins on each problem coding brute force.

## Thinking

- Write down thoughts.
- If stuck over 10 mins, reread statements.
	- Weird conditions
	- Properties
- Guess time complexity.
- Try to reduce the problem, but if stuck on an idea for over 5 minutes, try a different approach.
- Try to solve an easier version of the problem, but if stuck for over 5 minutes, try a different approach.
- After solving a problem or getting stuck, try taking a break from thinking for a couple minutes. After coming back, reset and pretend like you are starting a new contest.
- Possible Approaches:
    - Greedy
    - Sqrt
    - Random
    - Hashing
    - Data Structure
    - Binary Lifting
    - Binary Search
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Divide and Conquer
    - Offline
    - Backwards
    - Fix a variable
    - Visualize on a 2d Plane
    - Flows
    - Prefix Sums
    - Visualize as a graph/tree
- Make sure to spend at least 5 mins thinking about each type of algorithm.
- Try to combine algorithms.
